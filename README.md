# Revised Hierarchical Model
TODO:
* brief overview of architecture of RHM
* diagram of RHM

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
In order to load coactivations into the model, the user must first have run **bilingual_graph.py** to generate a **graph.pkl** file (see README_bilingualgraph for usage details).

### Parameters
The model uses a number of pre-set parameters that can be changed by the user via the SetParams command (TODO: add back into user menu interface).
TODO: list the params here

### Usage
RHM can be run using the following command:
```
python RHM.py
```
A command menu is immediately displayed.

              A: Auto-load co-activations
              C: Continue cycle
              Display activations:
                  D:    Enter 1 or more lemmas or concepts
                  D1:   All lemmas, singe plot
                  D10:  Top 10 word activations
              Enter Input
                  N:   Enter concept
              Print concepts/lemmas in lexicon
                  PC: Print concepts
                  PL: Print lemmas
              R:  Reset model
              F:  Load frequencies
              X:  Exit program

          Trial: 1 Cycle: 0 Mode: Ready

             Please enter an action: 
```
#### Loading coactivations
User types "a" or "A" into the command action line. The user will be prompted to enter the filename of the coactivation graph, which should simply be **graph.pkl**, which was generated by running **bilingual_graph.py**. 

**TODO: Finish documenting other commands**
